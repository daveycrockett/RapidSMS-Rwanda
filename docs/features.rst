View-Level Documentation
==========================

The next few sections provide a tab-by-tab (in Django-speak, view by view) breakdown of the functionality of RapidSMS Rwanda.  Each page will explain the high-level functional specifications of the page, followed by a more detailed technical explanation: example code of critical logic, models involved, etc.

The main tabs are:

* :doc:`Reporters and Groups <views/reporters_groups/index>`
* :doc:`Child & Maternity Health <views/child_maternity_health/index>`
* :doc:`Ambulances <views/ambulances/index>`
* :doc:`Messaging <views/messaging/index>`
* :doc:`Message Log <views/messagelog/index>`
